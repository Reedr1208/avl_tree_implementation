# AVL Tree Implementation

An AVL tree is a binary search tree data structure which employs an elegant self-balancing algorithm to maintain an optimal time complexity for find, delete, and sort operations.

In one of my earliest projects, I have implemented my own AVL tree python class from scratch and performed benchmark analysis against theoretical values for both the AVL Tree and native python lists. The experimental results support the theoretical time complexities and offer insights as to the data volume at which such data structures begin to outperform native structures.
